## Instructions

`npm install && npm start`

Then go to http://localhost:3000

---

Otherwise run

`npm install && npm run build && server -s build`

Then go to http://localhost:5000

## Extra

I was aware that Cynthia said that you reviewed these on Weds so I thought I'd get it done quite quickly as I have other offer deadlines to hit! Things I would have done having more time:

- The graphs etc on the info panel
- Testing! I didn't want to spend too long testing as this was going to take quite a long time anyway
- Wasn't sure how to implement the actual exchange functionality, I thought I might just have it update states in the store for balances etc. but decided against it as this would all be handled through an API really
- Wasn't sure whether to bring some fonts and icons in, perhaps could have looked at feather icons for the stock icon in the center
