# FX

## Instructions

`npm install && npm run serve`

Then go to http://localhost:5000

## Extra

- I've added a few tests, there are definitely other tests that should be written for things like the UI components etc.
- I've fixed all of the bugs mentioned by Cynthia, there may be other bugs given the absence of tests
- Not fixed the lack of numeric keyboard issue in the browser
- I added in a 'whitelistCurrencies' prop to Exchange in order to have a sensible sized list, feel free to play around with this to allow any other currencies through.
- Not submitting on enter press with wallet as this seems a bit too hasty rather than a click
